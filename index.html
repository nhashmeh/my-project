    <p>I am a planetary science graduate student at Tulane University. 
        My primary research interests involve using ground-based and remote sensing techniques 
        to spatially and quantitatively analyze the creation, modification, and composition of 
        various planetary terrain.

        My current project involves utilizing radar sounding data from ongoing Mars orbiter 
        missions in order to address questions regarding the nature of subsurface detections 
        (and lack thereof) within the south polar layered deposits (SPLD). Understanding the 
        radar behavior of the SPLD is part of a larger effort to intepret the paleoclimate 
        record stored within the stratigraphy of the ice.</p>
